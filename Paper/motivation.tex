\section{\method: Design Motivation}\label{motivate}

In this section, we describe the requirements to be satisfied while designing NNs for embedded systems within the \method\hspace{0.02in} methodology.
We motivate the NN design by comparing different efficiency optimization algorithms based on the privacy and efficiency requirements of embedded devices.
In this work, we specifically select the three state of the art design techniques for efficient model computation:\virat{didnt u mention this above? if yes, just refer to them don't rewrite}
\begin{itemize}
\item Model Compression via pruning redundant parameters and nodes
\item Quantization to lower the precision of model parameters and activations
\item Efficient off-the-shelf architectures
\end{itemize}

\virat{I don't understand the flow of this section: You state 3 requirements, but why only one is detailed? Why 3.4 is evaluation? I think you should state the overall design requirements at first, then explain each requirement in detail (why only 'efficiency' is detailed?)}

\virat{I think u need to move 3.4 up that shows the leakage, then discuss the requirements, then introduce gecko and show how it addresses the shortcomings you found in 3.4 and also the other requirements u discuss}

\subsection{Overall Design Requirements}

In designing our training methodology, \method, we aim to satisfy the following main requirements in the purview of embedded systems:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

\item {\em Privacy-}
The model should preserve the privacy of an individual's data record in the training set of the model against inference attacks.

\item {\em Efficiency-}
The private model should demonstrate high energy, memory and computation efficiency.

\item {\em Accuracy-}
The drop in accuracy of the private model should be minimum as compared to the non-private and non-efficient model accuracy.
\end{itemize}

To this end, we present \method --- a technique to construct NNs that are optimized for efficiency and accuracy while ensuring privacy of the input data.
With \method, we present a novel approach of building NNs with efficiency as a key property.
We argue that fixing a NN architecture and then modifying the training algorithm to ensure privacy (e.g. adversarial regularization[] and differential privacy[]) does not provide optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy.
On the contrary, our approach advocates building NN architecture considering the strengths and drawbacks of the underlying algorithms to design efficient NNs.
We assert that this is a practical solution as deep learning algorithms are flexible with respect to their architectures, i.e., different NNs can be trained to achieve the same accuracy for a given dataset.


\subsection{Efficiency Requirements}

In designing \method, we make several design choices with the goal of achieving efficiency over existing solutions.
The most important among them is the selection of the underlying algorithm to design NNs with high efficiency.
Several state of the algorithms are currently adopted such as, however, these algorithm do not provide the same efficiency guarantees.
These differences make it difficult to decide which primitive is the best fit for designing a privacy-preserving system for a particular application.
Therefore, we first outline the desirable properties specifically for private NN inference:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\em Energy Efficiency-} Energy consumption is a vital constraint for low powered embedded or IoT devices which operate for long duration while maximising their battery lifetime.
While executing NNs, every MAC requires memory access for reading weights, inputs and intermediate output from previous layer and one write to store the computed outputl which is significantly higher than actually performing the MAC operation in the CPU[].
Energy efficiency is achieved by reducing the memory access by (a) optimizing hardware to exploit sparsity in MACs and (b) reducing the precision to increase the throughput of data.

\item {\em Computation Efficiency-} The total multiply accumulate (MAC) operations between the parameter matrix and input activation function quantifies the requirement of computation efficiency.
The processing rate of MAC operations is constrained by the CPU on embedded device which is reduced by reducing the total number of parameters.
Additionally, replacing MACs with cheaper binary arithmetic significantly lowers the computational overhead.

\item {\em Memory Efficiency-} The total size of the model measured in terms of the memory storage for model parameters and additional runtime storage for intermediate outputs should be within the memory constraints of the embedded device.
This is achieved in two ways: (a) reducing the precision of the parameters and intermediate outputs and (b) pruning the parameters by increasing sparsity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization for Efficiency}

\red{Here, in the view of the above efficiency requirements, we compare the three baseline algorithms.
We then select an efficient design scheme for NNs that satisfies all our requirements.}
\virat{why is the choice of design scheme in motivation?}

\noindent\textbf{Memory Efficiency.} Off the shelf models are designed to specifically reduce the memory footprint.
For instance, the memory footprint of Squeezenet and MobileNet is 5MB and 14Mb compared to 250Mb of Alexnet and >500Mb of VGG architectures.
Additionally, lowering the model precision from 64 or 32 bit floating point to binary precision results in a direct reduction of 64x or 32x in the overall memory footprint of the model.
However, in case of model compression the model parameters which are pruned are simply replaced by a value of "0".
Hence, storing even the "0" parameter takes up memory and does not necessarily decrease the overall memory footprint unless the hardware is optimized to skip the storage of all the zero values in the memory.
This requires additional logic to check for zero valued parameters in a dictionary.

\input{fig_prune}
\input{fig_pruneRetrain}
\input{fig_wtsharing}

\noindent\textbf{Computation Efficiency.} Design of efficient off-the-shelf architectures replaces the complex matrix-vector multiplications by multiple matrix-vector multiplications with smaller dimensions.
This reduces the overall number of parameters but it has been shown empirically\footnote{https://github.com/albanie/convnet-burden} that this does not necessarily reduce the number of multiply accumulate operations or FLOPS~\cite{article}.
In case of parameter pruning, achieving efficiency requires additional hardware optimization. Particularly, instead of actually computing the the multiplications with "0"pruned values, the hardware optimization enable the user to skip the computation and replace the output by a "0" directly.
For quantized models with binarized parameters and activations the MAC operations can be replaced by binary operations such as XNOR and the maxpool operations can be replaced by OR operation, while the activations can be replaced by checking the parity bit (denotes the sign) operation and hence reducing the FLOPS drastically[XONN].
This results in high computational efficiency and hence, faster inference.


\noindent\textbf{Energy Efficiency.} Energy efficiency has been shown to not vary much in case of reduction with number of parameters and data type, number of memory accesses play vital role[CVPR 2017 yang et al][].
Specifically, for the case of off-the-shelf architectures the while the computation efficiency has been shown to improve, the energy efficiency has been shown to be close to large scale state of the art models like AlexNet[suqeezenet][].
Alternatively, for the case of model compression, energy efficiency can be achieved by additionally providing hardware optimization and shows small improvement in the energy consumption[].
For quantization, however, the energy efficiency has been shown to be high [][] where the memory access can be drastically reduced by increasing the throughput of data fetched from the memory.
Specifically, lowering the precision from 32 bit floating point to binary results in lowering the memory accesses and 32x improvement in energy consumption[][][].
While some improvement is seen natively for quantized models (from replacing MACs with XNOR), higher benefits can be achieved via additional hardware optimization[].
The benchmarking of energy consumption for different optimization and architectures is well explored in the literature and out of scope of this work. We refer the authors to [][][] for more details.

In summary, compared to different optimization techniques for NNs, the quantized architectures show significant benefit for different efficiency requirements over the other alternatives.


\subsection{Evaluating Privacy Leakage}

In this section, we evaluate the information leakage through membership inference attacks for the three baseline algorithms considered.
This is the main contribution of our work where we evaluate the privacy leakage for different optimization and design algorithms for NNs.

\subsubsection{Model Compression}

We evaluate the privacy leakage on compressing a model by pruning the connections in the model.
Here, pruning is achieved by replacing some of the parameters with "0" value.
As described in the original paper~\cite{}, pruning is followed by retraining the model to restore the model's original accuracy with the pruned connections.

We evaluate and validate the impact on membership privacy on compressing the model trained on three datasets: FashionMNIST, Location and Purchase100.
On pruning the model, the model's test accuracy decreases but also lowers the membership inference accuracy (Figure~\ref{fig:prune}).
This is expected as the parameters are responsible for memorizing the training data information and pruning the parameters lowers the adversary's attack success~\cite{rezawhite}.

However, interestingly, on retraining the pruned model, we observe that the membership inference accuracy is much higher than the original unpruned baseline model (Figure~\ref{fig:retrain}).
This indicates that model compression in turn increases the overall privacy leakage.
This can be attributed to the lower number of parameters forced to learn the same amount of information stored previously in the unpruned model with larger number of parameters.
In other words, the same amount of information is now captured by less number of parameters resulting in higher memorization of information per parameter.
To analyze the information stored per parameter, we first compute the model capacity as the mutual information of a trained network between the true label $Y$ and the predicted label $Y_{\theta}$ for a random input $X$ as derived in~\cite{45932,cap}.
Here, model's information $I(Y;Y_{\theta}|X) = $
\begin{equation}
N_{train}\left(1 - (r_{train}log_2(\frac{1}{r_{train}}) + (1-r_{train})log_2(\frac{1}{1-r_{train}}))\right)
\end{equation}
where $r_{train}$ is the classification train accuracy for all the $N_{train}$ samples in the training data.
For $r_{train} = 1$, the model completely memorizes all random samples as the information stored equals the number of samples $N_{train}$, while for $r_{train}=0.5$, the training accuracy 0.
We divide the above equation by the model's total number of parameters $N_{param}$ to get the per parameter information stored as
\begin{equation}
I_p(Y;Y_{\theta}|X) = \frac{I(Y;Y_{\theta}|X)}{N_{param}}
\end{equation}
As the model is compressed (pruned), the number of parameters $N_{param}$ decreases which results in increase in $I_p(Y;Y_{\theta}|X)$. However, on aggressive pruning, the train accuracy $r_{train}$ also decreases resulting in a decrease in the information per parameter, which is empirically indicated by a decrease in membership inference accuracy at the end in Figure~\ref{fig:retrain}.


\textbf{Mitigating the Privacy Risks in Pruned Models.} We describe on potential approach to mitigate the privacy risk of the compressed models without requiring to modify the model's training.
The post-hoc apporach utilizes the weight sharing for the compressed model. This is however, accompanied by a decrease in the model's prediction accuracy indicating a privacy-utility trade-off.
As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:wtsharing}, reducing the precision from 32 bits to 2 bits results in a decrease in inference accuracy from 56.57\% to 52.64\% for FashionMNIST, 62.08\% to 53.38\% for Location and 81.82\% to 61.95\% for Purchase100 dataset.
This decrease in inference attack accuracy is closely followed by a decrease in generalization error which is indicative of decrease in prediction accuracy of the model.
We evaluate the effectiveness of pruning followed by quantization which has been shown to have significant impact on reducing the model complexity through compression more significantly than either pruning or quantization alone.
For the experiments, we use the compressed model indicating highest privacy leakage to evaluate the effectiveness of weight sharing on the worst case condition.
This pipelined approach of pruning followed by retraining followed by weight sharing, not only maintains the algorithm's objective for efficiency but is used as a post-hoc approach to reduces the overall inference risk~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HanMD15,DBLP:journals/corr/HanPNMTECTD16}.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Model complexity influences the membership inference leakage. Model specifically designed for efficiency leak less information.}
\label{stdarch}
\end{table}

In this section, we evaluate two popular state of the art architectures, SqueezeNet and MobileNet, trained on CIFAR10 dataset used for low powered systems.
As seen in Table~\ref{stdarch}, the SqueezeNet and MobileNet models shows lower inference accuracy of 53.07\% and 55.57\% compared to larger models which have higher privacy leakage.

\input{fig_efficientArch}

Further, the inference accuracy of SqueezeNet and MobileNet can be further reduced close to random guess by increasing the temperature parameter of the softmax function applied to the output.
Increasing the temperature parameter reduces the granularity of the model's output and is given by $F_i(x) = \frac{e^{\frac{z_i(x)}{T}}}{\sum_{j}e^{\frac{z_j(x)}{T}}}$ where $z(x)$ computes output of the model before the softmax layer.
For the case of SqueezeNet, we are able to reduce the inference accuracy to 50.93\% from 53.07\% while for MobileNet we can reduce the inference accuracy to 52.62\% from 55.57\% as seen in Figure~\ref{softmax}.
This reduction in inference accuracy is without any cost of the prediction test accuracy of the model.




\subsubsection{Quantization}

In this section, we evaluate the technique of reducing the precision of both model's parameters and intermediate activations.
Further, we consider the extreme case of binarizing the parameters and activations allowing to evaluate on the most optimized case.
We evaluate on FashionMNIST dataset for two architectures with convolutional and fully connected layers.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Reducing the model precision lowers the inference attack accuracy but at the cost of test accuracy.}
\label{fmnist_quantize}
\end{table}

In both the architectures, we see that computation on  binarized parameters and activations reduces the inference risk by a small value.
However, on replacing the MAC operations with XNOR operations, we observe that the inference risk decreases close to random guess, however, at the cost of prediction test accuracy.

In summary, we observe that quantization, specifically binarization of parameters and activation along with XNOR computation, provides strong resistance against inference attacks compared to model compression and off-the-shelf architectures.

\subsection{Summary of Comparison}

We summarize the properties satisfied by each of the technique in terms of privacy, computation, memory and energy efficiency in Table~\ref{tbl:comparison}.
Here, we mark the attributes which are satisfied with $\cmark$, requires additional hardware optimization as $\smark$ and does not satisfy the property with a $\xmark$.

\begin{table}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.5}
\fontsize{6.7pt}{6.7pt}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|l|}
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Comparison of different optimizations for NNs. $\smark$: additional hardware optimization; $\xmark$: requirement not satisfied; $\cmark$: requirement satisfied.}
\label{tbl:comparison}
\end{table}

For our requirement, quantization of NNs is an attractive design choice which not only satisfies the computation, memory and energy efficiency but also provides high resistance against inference attacks.
Specifically, in this work we only consider the aggressive quantization of binarizing the parameters and activations to \{-1,+1\} values while additionally replacing the MAC operations with cheap and efficient binary arithmetic (XNOR operations).
Hence, we choose this particular design for NNs to provide a good three dimensional trade-off between privacy-efficiency-accuracy.
