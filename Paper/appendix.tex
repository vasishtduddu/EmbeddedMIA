\noindent\textbf{Purchase100.} This dataset is a privacy sensitive dataset capturing the purchase preferences of online customers taken from the authors of~\cite{shokri2017membership}.
The data records have 600 binary features and each record is classified into one of 100 classes identifying each user's purchase.
For this dataset, we use a fully connected architecture with the nodes in each layers as [1024,512,256,128,100].

\noindent\textbf{Location.} This dataset is a privacy sensitive dataset capturing user's location "check-ins" taken from the authors of~\cite{shokri2017membership} where each record has 446 binary features which is mapped to one of 30 classes each representing a location. For this dataset we use a fully connected architecture with hyperparameters as [512,256,128,30].
