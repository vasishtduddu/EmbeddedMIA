	abstract = {The changing nature of warfare has seen a paradigm shift from the conventional to asymmetric, contactless warfare such as information and cyber warfare. Excessive dependence on information and communication technologies, cloud infrastructures, big data analytics, data-mining and automation in decision making poses grave threats to business and economy in adversarial environments. Adversarial machine learning is a fast growing area of research which studies the design of Machine Learning algorithms that are robust in adversarial environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of this emerging area and the various techniques of adversary modelling. We explore the threat models for Machine Learning systems and describe the various techniques to attack and defend them. We present privacy issues in these models and describe a cyber-warfare test-bed to test the effectiveness of the various attack-defence strategies and conclude with some open problems in this area of research. },

	abstract = {How to train a binary neural network (BinaryNet) with both high compression rate and high accuracy on large scale dataset? We answer this question through a careful analysis of previous work on BinaryNets, in terms of training strategies, regularization, and activation approximation. Our findings first reveal that a low learning rate is highly preferred to avoid frequent sign changes of the weights, which often makes the learning of BinaryNets unstable. Secondly, we propose to use PReLU instead of ReLU in a BinaryNet to conveniently absorb the scale factor for weights to the activation function, which enjoys high computation efficiency for binarized layers while maintains high approximation accuracy. Thirdly, we reveal that instead of imposing L2 regularization, driving all weights to zero which contradicts with the setting of BinaryNets, we introduce a regularization term that encourages the weights to be bipolar. Fourthly, we discover that the failure of binarizing the last layer, which is essential for high compression rate, is due to the improper output range. We propose to use a scale layer to bring it to normal. Last but not least, we propose multiple binarizations to improve the approximation of the activations. The composition of all these enables us to train BinaryNets with both high compression rate and high accuracy, which is strongly supported by our extensive empirical study.},
