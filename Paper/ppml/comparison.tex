\section{Design Requirements}\label{design}

We construct NNs dedicated to IoT with efficiency, accuracy and privacy as main requirements:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

\item {\em Privacy.}
The model should preserve the privacy of an individual's data record in the training set of the model against inference attacks.

\item {\em Efficiency.}
The model should work with low energy, memory and computation capacity for practical deployment to embedded and mobile devices.

\item {\em Accuracy.}
The model should be highly accurate.
%accuracy degradation of the private and efficient model should be minimum as compared to the non-private and non-efficient model accuracy.
\end{itemize}
