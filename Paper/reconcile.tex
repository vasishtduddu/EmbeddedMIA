\section{Reconciling Robustness, Privacy and Efficiency}\label{reconcile}


Recent research has indicated that privacy and robustness are at odds with each other \cite{10.1145/3319535.3354211}, i.e, it was shown that robust models leak more about the training data.
Binary models protect against adversarial attacks much better than full precision NNs. \cite{lin2018defensive}\cite{8723317}
We show that XNOR Net can protect against inference attacks and hence we can provide a solution to design NNs which protect against both privacy and robustness violations while providing efficiency.
